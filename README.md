# Lua-Interpreter
This is an interpreter based on optimized abstract syntax tree, it executes instructions written by Lua. The interpreter uses a bunch of Lua instructions as input, firstly those instructions will be divided into several tokens, then be parsed to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree, finally the output of the whole bunch of code will be produced by traversing this syntax tree.
